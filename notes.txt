* we will be using babel; a javasript transpiler that converts ES6 code to backwards compatible vers of js in current and older browser envs
* we will be using web pack; as our module bundler; most widely used
* ensure files are in the correct folders as specified - in the tutorial he runs into an error for not having the 'components' folder in the 'src' folder
* make sure not to mispell anything!!!1 (I did)
* --save-dev saves the package as a dependency

Dependencies:

1. npm init - y;    creates a package.json file to keep track of our dependencies, dev dependencies and more; -y is shortcut for the defaults
2. npm install react;    is a library
3. npm install react-dom;    (DOM) has methods that can be used at the top-level of our web app
4. npm install webpack --save-dev;    dash dash save dev adds it as a dependency
5. npm install webpack-cli --save-dev;    increases speed and efficiency; provides commands to initialize a new webpack project; run webpack; watch for file changes and more
6. npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev;    this package gives us a single command live reload so when we save the server reloads the page w those changes
7. npm install @babel/core --save-dev;    is our code transpiler
8. npm install babel-loader --save-dev;    is a loader; which are what webpack uses to handle and process diff file types;loaders dictate how file types should be process as they are imported/loaded; this one traspiles javascript code; ex. Sass transpiles css
9. npm install @babel/preset-react --save-dev;    contains presets for all react plugin; has by default ES6 and preset React for jsx
10. npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev;   allows us to use latest javascript code without having to manage which syntax transforms are needed by envs like the browser; makes our code smaller which increases effenciency
11. npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev;    simplifies html file creation to serve our webpack bundles; ie assists in adding our bundled files to our html files

Next we will configure webpack:
(webpack if very malleable)

1. we create a "webpack.config.js" file; to put all our configuration, loaders, and other build information
2. we set up a module.exports at the very first line to export EVERYTHING from the file; to do so we wrap everything in curuly braces, ex. below
  
  - 1  module.exports = {
  - 2  ..................
  - 3  }

3. we tell webpack where the entrypoint of our application is; we want the entry point to be a file called "index.js" inside a file called "src"; the key 'entry' tells webpack which file it should use to create a dependency graph-is used to resolve modules which are dependent on one another while also building modules that are required by other modules first
  
  entry: './src/index.js'

4. we add 'index.js' file in a folder called 'src'
5. since webpack is expecting the entry to be in 'index.js' we will add some React code to it; to do so we import:

  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import App from './components/App';

  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

6. next we create the 'App' component in the 'components' folder we reference in the third line
7. in this file we:

  import React, { Component } from 'react'

  class App extends Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Implicit Null</h1>
        </div>
      )
    }
  }

  export default App;
  -keep in mind extending the React Component class gives us access to the component lifecycle methods and one of them is render; export default exports a class function or primitive from a javascript file

8. then we tell webpack the name and location of the bundled file that will be generated when we produce a production build; it is down with the key 'output'; here we bundle all our js files into one file called 'bundle.js'; when it is generate we want this to be placed in a folder named 'dist' to do this we define a path using the built in node 'path' module to use 'join' and '__dirname'; next we make it so our bundled js file will be loaded into an html file to do this we require the 'html-webpack-plugin'; we register this as a plugin use the key 'plugins' which has a value of an array holding plugins
  
  const path: require('path');
  const HTMLWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
  
  // this will be inside the object we are exporting
    output: {
      path: path.join(__dirname, '/dist'),
      filename: 'bundle.js'
    }
    
    plugins: [
      new HTMLWebpackPlugin({
        template: './src/index.html'
      })
    ]
    -this essentially tells webpack to inject the bundled files it generates into an html called 'index.html' file in our src folder

9. so we need to create an 'index.html' file in src folder
10. we also need to create a div with the id 'root' in that 'index.html' due to us looking for an element with id 'root' in our App.js
11. next we go back to webpack.config.js to inform webpack about the loader we are using; we will use babel; to do this we use the key 'module' and a 'rules'(which is an arr of objects) inside that module object to specify how our module is created; we also added in our first rule an 'exclude' so babel DOES NOT transpile node_modules since these are our libraries which we dont need to transpile

  // this will be inside the webpack object we are exporting
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /.js$/, <----- that is a regex saying to transfer all files that end in js; so we will use babel to transpile all files that end in .js
        exclude: /node_modules/, <------- so babel will ignore files in our node_modules
      }
    ]
  },
12. we then add what we want to do those things with; it will be babel-loader; we will do that using the 'use' keyword it will ahve a val of an object which accepts keys; we add the 'loader' key to specify our loader which will be 'babel-loader' then we add a 'options' key(which is an object that accepts keys) to add a 'presets' key(which is an array of strings) to add our installed presets which are listed in the example below

  // this is inside the first object in the rules array in module in our exported object
  use: {
    loader: 'babel-loader',
    options: {
    presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
  }

13. WE'RE DONE! WEBPACK IS CONFIGURED

Next we will create npm scripts to run our application:
(think of 'npm start' and the like)

1. our first scripts will be 'npm start'
2. to begin we delete the 'test' scripts
3. we add a "start" key with a val of a string "webpack-dev-server"; this will run our webpack dev server in DEVELOPMENT MODE; we will have one for production; this one runs a live reload server our --mode development specification will compile our code in development mode; when it starts we want it to display our application in a new tab so we add '--open'; we also want to add hot module replacement or 'hmr' to our dev enviroment, this exchanges/adds/removes modules while the application is running without requiring a full reload(making it more efficient) we do this by adding '--hot'

  "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open --hot"

After some debugging it works!!! With love reloading!!

Next lets setup our production enviroment:

1. to do this we need to add a "build" key to our scripts; we give it the value of "webpack --mode production" this runs it in production mode... so when we run "npm build" our js will be minified(meaning it is just one long line 'ugly') and bundled into a file called bundle. in a folder called '/dist' which was specified in our "output" in "webpack.congig.js"

  // this is in our scripts

  "build": "webpack --mode production"

2. when you run "npm run build" notice the /dist folder created that has some ~webpack magic~

AND THAT'S IT!
